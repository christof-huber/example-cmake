This example shows how to use cmake and git

# Git
1. First install [git](https://git-scm.com)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine `git clone git@github.com:christof-huber/example-cmake.git`
3. Play around with [git-commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Nothing bad can happen since the original version is
   savely stored in github.

# CMake
1. First install [CMake](https://cmake.org)
2. Create build-environment with `cmake .`
3. Build with `cmake --build .`
